# Private post-GAN Boosting

## American Census Data from 2010

This folder contains all data and code to replicate the findings and figures presented in Part 4.2 of Private post-GAN Boosting

## Contents

- figures: 		.png files of figures presented in paper
- gan-input:  .csv files for the GAN input
- models:     folder to store the intermediate weights of GAN training
- raw-data: 	original raw data sets (or instructions on how/where to get them)
- scripts: 		R and python code to replicate the analysis
- synthetic-output: folder to store the synthetic data generated by the four approaches in the paper
- census-2010.Rproj: Rproject for the toy-example

## How to get the raw data
- Go to [https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml).
- Click `Get Data` and select the 2010 10% sample.
- Select either all variables or only the ones used in the paper. (See code for variable names.)
- Place the resulting files in raw-data.
- Exchange the name of the .xml file in `01-data-preprocessing.R` to the name that was generated for your extract.
